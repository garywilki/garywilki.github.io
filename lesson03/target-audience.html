          Our vision is that Bakersfield Weather will be a favorite stop for
          people on-the-go, frequently commuting, visitors, or those stuck at
          home and seeking connections with the community. In each case we want
          to provide not only quick access to weather and news but also
          suggestions for local stops.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Generally we will be targeting people 20s and older in the Bakersfield
          and surrounding cities. We expect mobile access at least 70% of the
          time.
